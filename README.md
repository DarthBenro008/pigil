# Pigil

> A process vigilance system written in GoLang
## ü§î What is Pigil?

Pigil (Process vIGILance) is a self-hosted process watcher, that notifies you as soon as your process fails via an e-mail. It also maintains a record of all your commands for easier tracking.

Pigil keeps an eye on your processes when you have huge, time-taking builds and sends a notification via E-mail if the process fails to avoid any lapses in efficiency.


## üíª Usage

Pigil currently has the following commands: 

1. Install Pigil
2. Authenticate yourself via g-mail and link it with Pigil
   ```bash
   pigil bumf auth
   ```
3. Follow the link generated by Pigil and log-into your gmail account
4. Run any command just prefix pigil
   ```bash
    pigil <your command> # eg: pigil echo "This command is watched by pigil"
   ```
5. Any failure in the command will trigger an email notification on all your devices


### Pigil Commands


1. **`pigil <command>`**: will run the command and notify on failure
2. **`pigil bumf auth`**: will produce an authentication url
3. **`pigil bumf db`**: shows you the history of commands with thier execution time
