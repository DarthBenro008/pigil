# Pigil

> A process vigilance system written in GoLang

## ü§î What is Pigil?

Pigil (Process vIGILance) is a self-hosted process watcher, that notifies you as soon as your process fails via an e-mail. It also maintains a record of all your commands for easier tracking.

Pigil keeps an eye on your processes when you have huge, time-taking builds and sends a notification via E-mail if the process fails to avoid any lapses in efficiency.

## üíª Usage

Pigil currently has the following commands:

1. Install Pigil
2. Setup atleast one of the following notification channels:
   1. [Gmail Notifications](https://github.com/DarthBenro008/pigil/wiki/Setting-up-Gmail-Channel)
   2. [Discord Notifications](https://github.com/DarthBenro008/pigil/wiki/Setting-up-Discord-notification-channel)
3. Run any command just prefix pigil
   ```bash
    pigil <your command> # eg: pigil echo "This command is watched by pigil"
   ```
4. Any failure in the command will trigger an email notification on all your devices
